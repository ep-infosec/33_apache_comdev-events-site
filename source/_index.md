Welcome to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) events homepage!

The ASF runs and participates in a number
of events related to our Apache projects throughout the year. These events have three main purposes:

 * Educate the world about the work and mission of the ASF
 * Provide technical information about our many Apache projects
 * Build developer and user communities
