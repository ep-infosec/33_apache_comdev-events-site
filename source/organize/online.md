title: Running an online Apache event
---

If you want to run your community event on Apache's online events
platform, here's what you need to know.

 * Contact us at planners@apachecon.com to begin talking about your
   event.
 * We have an account on the [Hopin platform](https://hopin.com/)
 * Hosted events must be aproved by one or more Apache project PMCs.
   Provide a pointer to the discussion on your PMC mailing list for
   verification.
 * Events can be as long as 72 hours. There's no limit on the number of
   tracks or sessions you can run during that time.
 * Please provide an estimated number of attendees. While we know this
   can be very hard to estimate, getting some idea of how many attendees
   you'll have helps us with budget, since we pay per seat.
 * You will need to identify an event chair, who will be the primary
   contact person for communicating with the Conferences Committee. This
   helps to avoid miscommunication and contradictory decisions.
 * Your event chair must subscribe to the planners@apachecon.com mailing
   list for the duration of event planning, so that you can be informed
   about updates to policy, platform, and so on. Any questions you have
   about any aspect of the online events process should be asked there.
   This ensures that your question will be seen by more than one person.
   It also ensures that the answers are archived and available to other
   communities who are trying to solve the same problems.
