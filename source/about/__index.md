The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) runs, or participates in some fashion in,
a number of different types of
events, which different target audiences and goals, to educate about our
projects and about the Foundation, and to build the communities.

The main types of event we work with around Apache projects are:

  - [ApacheCon](/about/apachecon/index.html) - the ASF's official conference
  - [Roadshows](/about/roadshow.html) - bringing Apache content around the world
  - [Endorsed events](/about/endorsed.html) - run by third parties using Apache brands

If you want to organize your own event that uses Apache brands or trademarks in any way, we strongly encourage you to
[coordinate with us](/organize/index.html).
