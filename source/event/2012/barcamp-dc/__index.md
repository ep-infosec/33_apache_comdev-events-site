The Apache Software Foundation hosts an Apache BarCamp in the Washington, D.C. 
suburbs on May 19th, 2012.  

Being a BarCamp event, the agenda is ultimately determined by **you**, the attendees 
but we already anticipate great discussions on...

* The Apache Way
* Learn how to get started contributing to open source software
* Learn about machine learning with Apache Mahout
* Content detection/extraction with Apache Tika
