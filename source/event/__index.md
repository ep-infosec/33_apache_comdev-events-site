## Upcoming Apache events

This is the list of upcoming official Apache events, and
those events which have been approved to use Apache Marks under the 
[Third Party Event Branding Policy][1].

<ul id="events">
 <li><i>List loading</i></li>
</ul>

For a complete list of events see our [calendar](calendar.html).

In addition to Official Apache Events, there are a wide range of other
events which feature Apache projects and technologies. A crowd-source
list of these is maintained as a [Lanyrd Guide][2], and we encourage
people to help list related events here.
